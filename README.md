Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It is responsible for the whole process of software development, from a simple idea to an actual real time software, solving world problems.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of major programming languages like FORTRAN by John Backus and Algorithmic languages like C, C++ ,Java
Software being established as a discpline, which primarily occured in the 1960's
Edsger Dijkstra, a key figure in this concept, promoted the advent of structured programming in the 1970's


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering the needs of the user and what the system will need to produce that
Design: drafting the skeleton of the software by giving detailed designs of how it will be
Implementation: Writting the code that reflects the design
Testing: doing tests on the software to ensure that it works properly and that it is up to standard
Deployment: Releasing the complete software for use
Maintance: ensuring that the software remains functional by providing support and updates


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile method is fluid ,while waterfall method is cut in pieces. Waterfall method is not as flexible as Agile when it comes to development changes as one group finishes its duties completely before passing it on to the other. This makes the process even more expensive than the Agile method. Agile can work in both small and large projects whereas waterfall is only suitable for smaller projects.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: writes code and implements software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer: manages and ensures that the software is of high quality by conducting tests on the software
Project Manager: Oversees the whole process of software development.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDE's provide an environment for writting and editing code, debuging and testing. Examples include VS code, Eclipse.
VCS's help to track changes to the code during development for coordination., examples include GitHub.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
During development developers may encounter some serious changes that need to be done in the software. This might add more costs and develpment time. With more development time needed they might work ynder pressure to meet the deadline. The pressure might cost them even more in the shortcutes and ways to try to fasttrack the production process.
solutions include planning ahead for these types of instances to give the group efficient time to deal with possible delays. Also use the agile method of management, properly priorities the tasks of the project and constant reevaluation of the project timeline and goals. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing focuses on testing each module making sure that the components work properly individually.
Intergration testing focuses on how the modules work together in terms of their combined functionality.
System testing tests the whole software with all the components put together as a whole.
Acceptance testing now focuses on the interaction of the user and the software, making sure that the user is satisfied with the product.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It involves giving Ai models instructions and making use of the results given. Artificial intelligence gives better and more efficient respones at a faster rate reducing most costs.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: What book can I read?
Improved: can you suggest a romantic novel with  a strong male lead.
The more improved is more effective because it gives specif instructions which will lead to a less broad result.
